## Tic Tac Toe in Rust
Kinda pretty simple just the game made in rust. There are some known bugs with the win condition that I'll try and get to but the bigger aspect of this project is just getting familar with the rust synatx and seeing the performace over other languages like python. Feel free to view and like if you found any of this helpful... or jaring.
